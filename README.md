[![secureblue](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repo takes the uBlue starting point and selectively applies hardening with the following goals:

- Increase defenses against the exploitation of both known and unknown vulnerabilities.
- Avoid sacrificing usability for most use cases where possible

The following are not in scope for this project:
- Anything related to increasing "privacy", especially when at odds with improving security
- Anything related to "degoogling"

## What

Hardening applied:

- Setting numerous hardened sysctl values (Inspired by but not the same as Kicksecure's)
- Disabling coredumps in limits.conf
- Disabling all ports and services for firewalld
- Blacklisting numerous unused kernel modules to reduce attack surface
- Setting more restrictive file permissions (Based on recommendations from [lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/))
- Installing dnf-automatic and chkrootkit
- Disabling unprivileged user namespaces and removing flatpak
- Sets numerous hardening kernel parameters (Inspired by [Madaidan's Hardening Guide](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html))
- Installs and enables [hardened_malloc](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) globally
- Installing Chromium from the koji updates-testing repo to always have the latest version of chromium, the stable chromium package lags behind on security patches ([Why chromium?](https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing))

## Why

Fedora is one of the few distributions that ships with selinux and associated tooling built-in and enabled by default. This makes it advantageous as a starting point for building a hardened system. However, out of the box it's lacking hardening in numerous other areas. This project's goal is to improve on that significantly.

## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!


### Available Images

> Note: gaming utilities like Steam and Lutris are not included and in my experience are largely incompatible with hardened_malloc

- kinoite-main-hardened
- kinoite-nvidia-hardened
- silverblue-main-hardened
- silverblue-nvidia-hardened


### Rebasing

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/secureblue/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/secureblue/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
### Post-install

The following command is available to append kernel boot parameters that apply additional hardening (reboot required):

```
just set-kargs-hardening 
```
